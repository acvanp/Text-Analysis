"215" 1998 "HOW ZARATHUSTRA CAME INTO BEING."
"216" 1998 ""
"217" 1998 "\"Zarathustra\" is my brother's most personal work; it is the history of"
"218" 1998 "his most individual experiences, of his friendships, ideals, raptures,"
"219" 1998 "bitterest disappointments and sorrows. Above it all, however, there"
"220" 1998 "soars, transfiguring it, the image of his greatest hopes and remotest"
"221" 1998 "aims. My brother had the figure of Zarathustra in his mind from his very"
"222" 1998 "earliest youth: he once told me that even as a child he had dreamt of"
"223" 1998 "him. At different periods in his life, he would call this haunter of his"
"224" 1998 "dreams by different names; \"but in the end,\" he declares in a note on"
"225" 1998 "the subject, \"I had to do a PERSIAN the honour of identifying him with"
"226" 1998 "this creature of my fancy. Persians were the first to take a broad and"
"227" 1998 "comprehensive view of history. Every series of evolutions, according"
"228" 1998 "to them, was presided over by a prophet; and every prophet had his"
"229" 1998 "'Hazar,'--his dynasty of a thousand years.\""
"230" 1998 ""
"231" 1998 "All Zarathustra's views, as also his personality, were early conceptions"
"232" 1998 "of my brother's mind. Whoever reads his posthumously published writings"
"233" 1998 "for the years 1869-82 with care, will constantly meet with passages"
"234" 1998 "suggestive of Zarathustra's thoughts and doctrines. For instance, the"
"235" 1998 "ideal of the Superman is put forth quite clearly in all his writings"
"236" 1998 "during the years 1873-75; and in \"We Philologists\", the following"
"237" 1998 "remarkable observations occur:--"
"238" 1998 ""
"239" 1998 "\"How can one praise and glorify a nation as a whole?--Even among the"
"240" 1998 "Greeks, it was the INDIVIDUALS that counted.\""
"241" 1998 ""
"242" 1998 "\"The Greeks are interesting and extremely important because they reared"
"243" 1998 "such a vast number of great individuals. How was this possible? The"
"244" 1998 "question is one which ought to be studied."
"245" 1998 ""
"246" 1998 "\"I am interested only in the relations of a people to the rearing of"
"247" 1998 "the individual man, and among the Greeks the conditions were unusually"
"248" 1998 "favourable for the development of the individual; not by any means owing"
"249" 1998 "to the goodness of the people, but because of the struggles of their"

"257" 1998 "The notion of rearing the Superman is only a new form of an ideal"
"258" 1998 "Nietzsche already had in his youth, that \"THE OBJECT OF MANKIND SHOULD"

"274" 1998 ""
"275" 1998 "The phrase \"the rearing of the Superman,\" has very often been"
"276" 1998 "misunderstood. By the word \"rearing,\" in this case, is meant the act of"
"277" 1998 "modifying by means of new and higher values--values which, as laws and"
"278" 1998 "guides of conduct and opinion, are now to rule over mankind. In general"
"279" 1998 "the doctrine of the Superman can only be understood correctly in"
"280" 1998 "conjunction with other ideas of the author's, such as:--the Order"
"281" 1998 "of Rank, the Will to Power, and the Transvaluation of all Values. He"
"282" 1998 "assumes that Christianity, as a product of the resentment of the botched"
"283" 1998 "and the weak, has put in ban all that is beautiful, strong, proud, and"
"284" 1998 "powerful, in fact all the qualities resulting from strength, and that,"
"285" 1998 "in consequence, all forces which tend to promote or elevate life have"
"286" 1998 "been seriously undermined. Now, however, a new table of valuations"
"287" 1998 "must be placed over mankind--namely, that of the strong, mighty, and"
"288" 1998 "magnificent man, overflowing with life and elevated to his zenith--the"
"289" 1998 "Superman, who is now put before us with overpowering passion as the"
"290" 1998 "aim of our life, hope, and will. And just as the old system of valuing,"
"291" 1998 "which only extolled the qualities favourable to the weak, the suffering,"
"292" 1998 "and the oppressed, has succeeded in producing a weak, suffering, and"
"293" 1998 "\"modern\" race, so this new and reversed system of valuing ought to rear"
"294" 1998 "a healthy, strong, lively, and courageous type, which would be a glory"
"295" 1998 "to life itself. Stated briefly, the leading principle of this new system"
"296" 1998 "of valuing would be: \"All that proceeds from power is good, all that"

"298" 1998 ""

"302" 1998 "Darwinian sense) of which we can know nothing, and which it would"
"303" 1998 "therefore be somewhat absurd to strive after. But it is meant to be"

"306" 1998 ""

"310" 1998 "strong Romedom, was almost annihilated or transvalued in a comparatively"
"311" 1998 "short time. Could not a rejuvenated Graeco-Roman system of valuing (once"
